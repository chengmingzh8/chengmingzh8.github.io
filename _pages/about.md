I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Indiana University in May 2024, where I was a member of the [HiPDAC group](https://www.dingwentao.com/hipdac) working on building efficient and scalable deep learning system and advised by [Prof. Dingwen Tao](https://www.dingwentao.com/). I have extensive industry research experience and has participated in multiple research projects in laboratories such as Microsoft Research, meta Reality Labs, Argonne National Laboratory.

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/).

**I am actively looking for multiple fully funded Ph.D. students** who are intersted in the following research directions:

* Efficient machine learning systems (training/inference on parallel/distributed/heterogeneous hardware)
* Effective efficiency algorithms (model compression, data efficiency, parameter-efficient tuning, etc.)
* Large-scale DL/AI applications (Large Language Model, Agent, Image/Video Generation, DLRM, etc.)

If you are interested, please send me an email at chengmingzh@gmail.com with you your CV/resume, transcripts and any materials that you think are helpful.

**Our lab is exclusively equipped with multiple high-performance computing servers worth a total of $130K (two 8-Ada6000 servers and one dual-4090 servers).**
